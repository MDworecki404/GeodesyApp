<b>Geodesy</b> - science dealing with determining the size and shape of the Earth and determining the location of points on its surface. The result of geodetic field measurements and in-house work are various types of graphic studies, e.g. maps or profiles, but also text documents of a legal nature (e.g. during real estate demarcation).

<b>Geodetic measurement methods</b>:

Trigonometric Levelling - one of the types of leveling. The measurement of height differences of points is performed on the basis of the measured horizontal distances and vertical angles. It consists in determining the height difference between two terrain points using the rules of trigonometry. In order to determine the height difference, the horizontal length between the terrain points and the inclination angle of the section between the terrain points should be measured.
The accuracy of determining the height difference using trigonometric leveling is higher than the accuracy of determining the difference using barometric leveling, and using modern precision instruments is comparable to the accuracy of determining this difference using geometric leveling.

Hp = HA + HI + AD * cos(Z) - CB

Polar Method - field detail measurement method. It consists in determining the length d of the target axis (distance) from the known control point to the removed point and the angle Î± between the control line side and the target axis.
